# getting_and_cleaning_data
This is my Course Project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
We are required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with our script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that we performed to clean up the data 
called CodeBook.md. We also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts 
work and how they are connected.  
The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
